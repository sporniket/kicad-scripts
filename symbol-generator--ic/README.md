# Symbol generator for Integrated Circuits (IC)

A collection of Python scripts to help convert or generate some of the files.

## Synopsyses

### jsonFromDatasheet.py [source_md] [dest_json]

Convert a normalized Markdown datasheet of an IC into an json descriptor, to be used as input for `libItemFromJsonDatasheet` and `libItemPhyFromJsonDatasheet`.

### libItemFromJsonDatasheet.py [source_json] [dest_symbol]

Generate a collection of symbols (one single unit symbol, one multi-units symbol) from the specified json descriptor for an IC.

### libItemPhyFromJsonDatasheet [source_json] [dest_symbol]

Generate a symbol where pins are laid out like the physical package, from the specified json descriptor for an IC.

### compileSymbols [source_symbol ...] [dest_lib]

Gather all the symbols generated by `libItemFromJsonDatasheet` and `libItemPhyFromJsonDatasheet` into a single library of symbols for Kicad.

## Normalized Markdown structured datasheet

_See template-datasheet.md_

## Application note

Here is an exemple schell script illustrating the chaining of the scripts. The `$TOOL_PATH` points to the folder containing the scripts.
